# Tensorflow Developer Preparation
A collection of Jupyter notebooks that I have studied/created during preparation for Tensorflow Developer Certificate. The notebooks have been organized under Image, NLP, Time Series and Save-Load-model categories.
# Content
- **Image** - notebooks related to loading/reading image datasets in Tensorflow. Training and fine tuning image classification models using CNNs, data augmentation and custom callbacks.
- **NLP** - notebooks related to loading/reading text datasets in Tensorflow. Training and fine tuning text classification, sentiment analysis models using LSTMS, RNNs, GRUs
- **Time Series** - notebooks related to working with time series data using RNNs, LSTMs, Stateful RNNs and etc.
- **Save-Load model** - notebook for saving and loading tensorflow models in various formats
